# My Recent Project: ActiveCpp

I am excited to share my recent project, ActiveCpp, which is now live on my website [samiralavi.github.io/activecpp/main](https://samiralavi.github.io/activecpp/main/). ActiveCpp is a powerful and versatile C++ library that simplifies asynchronous programming and enables developers to create highly responsive applications.

## Why ActiveCpp?

As a software developer, I have always been fascinated by the potential of asynchronous programming. However, I often found it challenging to write efficient and maintainable asynchronous code in C++. That's when I decided to create ActiveCpp. The original idea was in an abandoned repository [lightful/syscpp](https://github.com/lightful/syscpp), which helped me at the time a lot. Therefore I decided to revive this dead project and support it to further help the engineers like me develop event-driven systems in Modern C++ more efficiently.

ActiveCpp provides a set of intuitive and easy-to-use abstractions that make it effortless to write asynchronous code. It leverages the power of coroutines and event-driven programming to handle concurrency and improve the responsiveness of C++ applications.

## Key Features

ActiveCpp offers several key features that make it a valuable tool for C++ developers:

### 1. Asynchronous Execution

With ActiveCpp, you can easily define and execute asynchronous tasks. By using coroutines, you can write code that appears synchronous but executes asynchronously, allowing your application to remain responsive.

### 2. Event-Driven Programming

ActiveCpp embraces the event-driven programming paradigm, allowing you to handle events and triggers efficiently. You can define event handlers and subscribe to events, making it easier to build reactive and event-based systems.

### 3. Task Scheduling

The library provides a flexible task scheduling mechanism that allows you to control the execution order and prioritize tasks. You can schedule tasks to run in parallel or sequentially, depending on your application's requirements.

### 4. Error Handling

ActiveCpp simplifies error handling in asynchronous code. It provides mechanisms to propagate and handle errors gracefully, making it easier to write robust and fault-tolerant applications.

## Getting Started with ActiveCpp

To get started with ActiveCpp, head over to [samiralavi.github.io/activecpp/main](https://samiralavi.github.io/activecpp/main/) and explore the documentation and examples. You will find comprehensive guides, tutorials, and API references to help you understand and utilize the library effectively.

## Conclusion

ActiveCpp is a game-changer for C++ developers who want to harness the power of asynchronous programming. With its intuitive abstractions and powerful features, it simplifies the process of writing responsive and efficient code. I invite you to check out the project on my website and give it a try in your next C++ project.

Happy coding!
