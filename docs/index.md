As an embedded systems engineer, I have designed different types of embedded systems in several areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), industrial control systems, and communication networks. I try to employ the latest technologies for software and hardware development, from embedded Linux to different real-time operating systems (RTOSs), and agile software development processes. Model-based embedded system design and implementation is my main expertise, which I have done during the last several years. During my doctoral study at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), I have worked on the development of multi-agent embedded systems for distributed control power systems, which operate over IoT wireless communications protocols with different objectives. I have published several papers in high impact engineering journals and presented my research in top rank conferences around the world.
