As an embedded systems engineer, I have designed different types of embedded systems in several areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), industrial control systems, and communication networks. I try to employ the latest technologies for software and hardware development, from embedded Linux to different real-time operating systems (RTOSs), and agile software development processes. Model-based embedded system design and implementation is my main expertise, which I have done during the last several years. During my doctoral study at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), I have worked on the development of multi-agent embedded systems for distributed control power systems, which operate over IoT wireless communications protocols with different objectives. I have published several papers in high impact engineering journals and presented my research in top rank conferences around the world. Currently, I am working at Riverlane on control systems for Quantum computers.

I have received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Power and Water University of Technology (PWUT), Tehran, Iran, in 2013 and the M.Sc. degree in control systems engineering from Shahid Beheshti University (SBU), Tehran, Iran in 2017. Currently, I am a PhD student in the field of networked control systems for smart grids at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), London, United Kingdom. My PhD research was about distributed control and estimation of microgrids based on constrained communication networks.
