I try to employ the latest technologies for software and hardware development from embedded Linux to different real-time operating systems (RTOSs) for 8 bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. Advanced embedded systems design and implementation is my main expertise, which I have done during the last several years. I have received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Power and Water University of Technology (PWUT), Tehran, Iran, in 2013 and the M.Sc. degree in control systems engineering from Shahid Beheshti University (SBU), Tehran, Iran in 2017. Currently, I am a PhD student in the field of networked control systems for smart grids at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), London, United Kingdom. My PhD research is about distributed control and estimation of DC microgrids, under supervision of Dr Kamyar Mehran .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#my-personal-website","text":"","title":"My Personal Website"},{"location":"#biography","text":"As an embedded systems engineer, I have designed different types of embedded systems in several areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), control systems and communication networks.
